### Development

Agile is not just a nice word for us, we consider that agile methodologies help us to do a better job. By focusing on giving real value to our partners at the end of each sprint (period of time, usually two weeks) and by being more adaptable to upcoming changes. It also allows us to get quick feedback in order to validate the software being developed and be sure that it gets its job done.
