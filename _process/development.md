### Development

Agile is not just a nice word for us, we consider that agile methodologies help us do a better job. Especially focusing on giving real value to our partners at the end of each sprint (usually a two-weeks period) and adapting to upcoming changes. It also allows us to get quick feedback in order to validate the software being developed and be sure that it gets the job done.
