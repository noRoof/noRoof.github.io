## Our pillars

**Communicating fluently** helps us do a greater job. In our experience things go well when we trust each other and we put communication as a priority.

We are **transparent**. We will be honest with what we can or can’t do, and if we know who can help you better than us, we will refer you to them.

It is impossible to deliver good results for us if we only focus on technology. We consider that having a good understanding of the problem and the possible solution is critical for both (you and us), we need to be on the same page to deliver the expected software.  

We are confident in our **technical expertise**, but we are even more confident in the abilities that we are constantly developing to bring better solutions to our partners. That’s the only way that we know to be up to date with cutting-edge technologies.

  <summary>Security, User Experience, Performance and Quality?</summary>
  <p>There are some aspects of the software on which we pay special attention because we consider  critical to almost every application.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Security</b> is a must, so we focus on being up to date with the best practices to develop secure applications.</li>
    <li>If users don’t like what we do, they won’t come back. Applications having great <b>User Experience</b> will have many competitive advantages, from reducing training costs to improving users conversion rate.</li>
    <li>Great UX is difficult to reach without good <b>performance</b>. This is another thing to which we pay attention from the beginning and when the application scales.</li>
    <li><b>Quality</b> can’t be out of the list.It is very important for us to make sure that what we do has top-quality standards from analysis, design and development to delivered software.</li>
  </ul>
